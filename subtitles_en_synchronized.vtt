00:00:00.501 00:00:06.298 [upbeat music]

00:00:33.784 00:00:36.161 your quarterlies
00:00:33.784 00:00:36.161 look very good.
00:00:36.161 00:00:38.330 How are things going
00:00:36.161 00:00:38.330 at the library?
00:00:38.330 00:00:40.958 Oh, I told you.

00:00:40.958 00:00:44.252 So you've come
00:00:40.958 00:00:44.252 to the master for guidance?
00:00:44.252 00:00:46.672 [Chinese accent] Is this what
00:00:44.252 00:00:46.672 you're saying, Grasshopper?
00:00:46.672 00:00:48.173 Uh, actually,

00:01:09.403 00:01:11.071 You're gentleman

00:01:14.950 00:01:16.159 Okay.
00:01:14.950 00:01:16.159 I'm sorry.
00:01:16.159 00:01:18.161 My mistake.
00:01:18.161 00:01:19.204 [clears throat]
00:01:19.204 00:01:21.540 That was a woman
00:01:19.204 00:01:21.540 I was talking to.
00:01:21.540 00:01:24.752 So.
00:01:21.540 00:01:24.752 She had a very low voice.
00:01:24.752 00:01:26.837 Probably a smoker.
00:01:26.837 00:01:30.131 So...
00:01:26.837 00:01:30.131 [clears throat]
00:01:30.131 00:01:31.466 So that's the way it's done.
00:01:31.466 00:01:34.093 I've, uh, I've been
00:01:31.466 00:01:34.093 at Dunder Mifflin
00:01:34.093 00:01:35.136 for 12 years.
00:01:35.136 00:01:37.639 The last four
00:01:35.136 00:01:37.639 as regional manager.
00:01:37.639 00:01:40.935 Uh, if you wanna
00:01:37.639 00:01:40.935 come through here.
00:01:40.935 00:01:43.102 Ah, see, we have
00:01:40.935 00:01:43.102 the entire floor.
00:01:43.102 00:01:45.773 So this is my kingdom,
00:01:43.102 00:01:45.773 far as the eye can see.
00:01:45.773 00:01:48.149 Ah, this
00:01:45.773 00:01:48.149 is our receptionist Pam.
00:01:48.149 00:01:50.151 [imitating Bam-Bam]
00:01:48.149 00:01:50.151 Pam! Pam, Pam!
00:01:50.151 00:01:51.194 Pam Beasley.
00:01:51.194 00:01:55.156 Uh, Pam has been with us,
00:01:51.194 00:01:55.156 um...for...forever.
00:01:55.156 00:01:56.157 Right, Pam?
00:01:56.157 00:01:57.158 Well, I don't know.
00:01:57.158 00:01:58.159 If you think
00:01:57.158 00:01:58.159 she's cute now,
00:01:58.159 00:02:00.161 you should have seen her
00:01:58.159 00:02:00.161 a couple of years ago.
00:02:00.161 00:02:01.162 Reow, reow.
00:02:01.162 00:02:02.163 What?
00:02:02.163 00:02:03.832 Uh, any messages?
00:02:03.832 00:02:06.627 Um...yeah.
00:02:03.832 00:02:06.627 Just a fax.
00:02:06.627 00:02:08.545 Oh.
00:02:08.545 00:02:09.964 Pam, this is from corporate.
00:02:09.964 00:02:11.172 How many times
00:02:09.964 00:02:11.172 have I told you
00:02:11.172 00:02:12.591 that there's
00:02:11.172 00:02:12.591 a special filing cabinet
00:02:12.591 00:02:13.884 for things from corporate?
00:02:13.884 00:02:15.052 You haven't told me--
00:02:15.052 00:02:16.344 It's called
00:02:15.052 00:02:16.344 the wastepaper basket!
00:02:16.344 00:02:18.680 [bawdy laugh]
00:02:18.680 00:02:21.100 Look at that!
00:02:21.100 00:02:22.893 Oh, look at that face.
00:02:22.893 00:02:24.853 People say
00:02:22.893 00:02:24.853 I am the best boss.
00:02:24.853 00:02:26.229 They go,
00:02:26.229 00:02:28.189 "God, we've never worked
00:02:26.229 00:02:28.189 in a place like this before.
00:02:28.189 00:02:30.191 "You're hilarious.
00:02:30.191 00:02:32.277 And you get the best
00:02:30.191 00:02:32.277 out of us."
00:02:32.277 00:02:35.196 Um...
00:02:35.196 00:02:38.826 I think that
00:02:35.196 00:02:38.826 pretty much sums it up.
00:02:38.826 00:02:40.995 I found it at Spencer Gifts.
00:02:43.872 00:02:47.417 [singing]

00:02:56.217 00:02:58.219 Pa rum pa pum pum
00:02:58.219 00:03:00.347 [imitating drums]
00:03:00.347 00:03:04.101 My job is to speak to clients,
00:03:00.347 00:03:04.101 um, on the phone,
00:03:04.101 00:03:07.395 about...
00:03:04.101 00:03:07.395 uh, quantities
00:03:07.395 00:03:12.651 and, uh, type of...
00:03:07.395 00:03:12.651 copier paper.
00:03:12.651 00:03:15.779 You know, whether
00:03:12.651 00:03:15.779 we can supply it to them,
00:03:15.779 00:03:18.573 whether they can, uh...
00:03:18.573 00:03:19.616 pay for it.
00:03:19.616 00:03:21.910 And, um...
00:03:21.910 00:03:24.997 [clicks tongue]
00:03:24.997 00:03:28.583 I'm--I'm boring myself

00:04:05.495 00:04:07.455 All right.
00:04:07.455 00:04:08.916 Take care.
00:04:08.916 00:04:10.250 Back to work!
00:04:14.671 00:04:16.673 Just try to reach him
00:04:14.671 00:04:16.673 sometime today.
00:04:16.673 00:04:18.967 Um, I don't know,
00:04:16.673 00:04:18.967 just before lunch.
00:04:18.967 00:04:20.343 That would be great.
00:04:20.343 00:04:22.470 Corporate really doesn't
00:04:20.343 00:04:22.470 interfere with me at all.
00:04:22.470 00:04:23.555 Jan Levenson-Gould--
00:04:23.555 00:04:25.306 Jan! Hello!
00:04:25.306 00:04:27.726 I call her
00:04:25.306 00:04:27.726 Hillary Rodham Clinton.
00:04:27.726 00:04:30.062 Right?
00:04:27.726 00:04:30.062 Not to her face, because, uh--
00:04:30.062 00:04:32.606 Well, not because
00:04:30.062 00:04:32.606 I'm scared of her.
00:04:32.606 00:04:34.357 Because I'm not.
00:04:34.357 00:04:37.402 But, um, yeah.
00:04:37.402 00:04:39.947 All right, was there anything
00:04:37.402 00:04:39.947 you wanted to add to the agenda?
00:04:39.947 00:04:43.909 Mmm...me no get
00:04:39.947 00:04:43.909 an agenda.
00:04:43.909 00:04:45.452 I'm sor--What?
00:04:43.909 00:04:45.452 I'm sorry?
00:04:45.452 00:04:47.079 I didn't get
00:04:45.452 00:04:47.079 any agenda.
00:04:47.079 00:04:48.747 Well, I faxed one over
00:04:47.079 00:04:48.747 to you this morning.
00:04:48.747 00:04:51.083 Really? 'Cause it didn't,
00:04:48.747 00:04:51.083 uh, I didn't--
00:04:51.083 00:04:53.168 Did we get a fax
00:04:51.083 00:04:53.168 this morning?
00:04:53.168 00:04:54.711 Uh, yeah, the one--
00:04:54.711 00:04:58.423 Then why--why isn't
00:04:54.711 00:04:58.423 it in my hand?
00:04:58.423 00:05:00.926 Because a company runs
00:04:58.423 00:05:00.926 on efficiency of communication.
00:05:00.926 00:05:02.594 Right? Just...
00:05:00.926 00:05:02.594 [imitates gun firing]
00:05:02.594 00:05:04.345 Um, so what's the problem,
00:05:02.594 00:05:04.345 Pam?
00:05:04.345 00:05:07.266 Why didn't, uh,
00:05:04.345 00:05:07.266 why didn't I get it?
00:05:07.266 00:05:09.350 You put it
00:05:07.266 00:05:09.350 in the garbage can
00:05:09.350 00:05:11.311 that was a special
00:05:09.350 00:05:11.311 filing cabinet.
00:05:14.439 00:05:16.357 Yeah!
00:05:14.439 00:05:16.357 Uh, that was a joke.
00:05:16.357 00:05:18.152 That was a joke
00:05:16.357 00:05:18.152 that, uh,
00:05:18.152 00:05:19.903 was actually
00:05:18.152 00:05:19.903 my brother's.
00:05:19.903 00:05:21.029 And it was--
00:05:19.903 00:05:21.029 [laughs]
00:05:21.029 00:05:22.363 it was supposed
00:05:21.029 00:05:22.363 to be with bills,
00:05:22.363 00:05:23.740 and it doesn't
00:05:22.363 00:05:23.740 work great with faxes.
00:05:23.740 00:05:25.159 - Do you wanna look at mine?
00:05:23.740 00:05:25.159 - Yeah.
00:05:25.159 00:05:26.910 Yeah, I would.
00:05:25.159 00:05:26.910 Thank you.
00:05:26.910 00:05:28.996 Okay, since
00:05:26.910 00:05:28.996 the last meeting,
00:05:28.996 00:05:30.371 Alan and the board
00:05:28.996 00:05:30.371 have decided
00:05:30.371 00:05:32.373 that we can't justify
00:05:30.371 00:05:32.373 a Scranton branch
00:05:32.373 00:05:33.374 and a Stanford branch.
00:05:33.374 00:05:34.668 Oh, okay.
00:05:34.668 00:05:35.669 Michael, don't panic--
00:05:35.669 00:05:36.795 No, no, no, no.
00:05:35.669 00:05:36.795 This is good.
00:05:36.795 00:05:38.379 This is good.
00:05:36.795 00:05:38.379 This is fine, excellent.
00:05:38.379 00:05:39.798 Michael, listen,
00:05:38.379 00:05:39.798 okay, don't panic.
00:05:39.798 00:05:42.009 Although alarm bells are
00:05:39.798 00:05:42.009 kinda going ringy dingy dingy!
00:05:42.009 00:05:43.384 We haven't made
00:05:42.009 00:05:43.384 any decisions yet.
00:05:43.384 00:05:44.636 I've spoken to Josh
00:05:43.384 00:05:44.636 in Stanford.
00:05:44.636 00:05:46.054 I've told him
00:05:44.636 00:05:46.054 the same as you,
00:05:46.054 00:05:47.764 and it's up to either
00:05:46.054 00:05:47.764 you or him to convince me
00:05:47.764 00:05:49.474 that your branch
00:05:47.764 00:05:49.474 can incorporate the other.
00:05:49.474 00:05:51.101 Okay, no problem.
00:05:51.101 00:05:53.394 This does, however, mean that
00:05:51.101 00:05:53.394 there's going to be downsizing.
00:05:53.394 00:05:54.562 Me no wanna
00:05:53.394 00:05:54.562 hear that, Jan.
00:05:54.562 00:05:56.315 Because downsizing
00:05:54.562 00:05:56.315 is a bitch.
00:05:56.315 00:05:58.525 It is a real bitch.
00:05:58.525 00:06:01.903 And I wouldn't wish that
00:05:58.525 00:06:01.903 on Josh's men.
00:06:01.903 00:06:04.114 I certainly wouldn't
00:06:01.903 00:06:04.114 wish it on my men.
00:06:04.114 00:06:06.449 Or women,
00:06:04.114 00:06:06.449 present company excluded.
00:06:06.449 00:06:07.909 Sorry, uh...
00:06:07.909 00:06:11.246 Is Josh concerned
00:06:07.909 00:06:11.246 about downsizing, himself?
00:06:11.246 00:06:12.413 Not downsizing himself,
00:06:12.413 00:06:13.874 but is he concerned about
00:06:12.413 00:06:13.874 downsizing?
00:06:17.878 00:06:19.420 Ha ha ha ha!
00:06:19.420 00:06:20.881 Question: How long
00:06:19.420 00:06:20.881 do we have to act--
00:06:20.881 00:06:23.217 [telephone rings]
00:06:23.217 00:06:25.426 Oh, Todd Packer.
00:06:23.217 00:06:25.426 Terrific rep.
00:06:25.426 00:06:26.469 Do you mind
00:06:25.426 00:06:26.469 if I take it?
00:06:26.469 00:06:27.679 Go right ahead.
00:06:27.679 00:06:28.972 Packman.
00:06:28.972 00:06:30.349 (Todd)
00:06:28.972 00:06:30.349 Hey, you big queen!
00:06:30.349 00:06:32.059 Oh, that's not...
00:06:30.349 00:06:32.059 appropriate.
00:06:32.059 00:06:34.435 Hey, is old Godzillary
00:06:32.059 00:06:34.435 coming in today?
00:06:34.435 00:06:36.230 Um, I don't know.
00:06:34.435 00:06:36.230 I don't know what you mean.
00:06:36.230 00:06:39.358 Look, I've been meaning
00:06:36.230 00:06:39.358 to ask her one question.
00:06:39.358 00:06:41.360 Does the carpet
00:06:39.358 00:06:41.360 match the drapes?
00:06:41.360 00:06:42.861 Oh, my God.
00:06:42.861 00:06:44.279 Ohh!
00:06:44.279 00:06:47.032 That's...horrifying.
00:06:48.158 00:06:49.701 And horrible.
00:06:49.701 00:06:52.579 Horrible person.
00:06:52.579 00:06:55.874 So do you think we could
00:06:52.579 00:06:55.874 keep a lid on this for now?
00:06:55.874 00:06:57.667 I don't wanna worry people
00:06:55.874 00:06:57.667 unnecessarily.
00:06:57.667 00:06:58.919 No, absolutely.
00:06:58.919 00:07:00.379 Under this regime,
00:07:00.379 00:07:01.963 it will not
00:07:00.379 00:07:01.963 leave this office.
00:07:01.963 00:07:03.715 Just...like that.
00:07:03.715 00:07:05.842 [whispering] So what does
00:07:03.715 00:07:05.842 downsizing actually mean?
00:07:05.842 00:07:07.219 Well...
00:07:07.219 00:07:09.263 [whispering] You guys
00:07:07.219 00:07:09.263 gotta update your resumes,
00:07:09.263 00:07:10.305 just like I'm doing.
00:07:10.305 00:07:11.681 I bet it's gonna be me.
00:07:11.681 00:07:13.975 It's probably gonna be me.
00:07:13.975 00:07:15.476 Yeah, it'll be you.
00:07:15.476 00:07:17.062 I have an important
00:07:15.476 00:07:17.062 question for you.
00:07:17.062 00:07:18.521 Yes?
00:07:18.521 00:07:21.275 [laughing] Um, are you going
00:07:18.521 00:07:21.275 to Angela's cat party on Sunday?
00:07:21.275 00:07:23.526 Yeah. Stop.
00:07:21.275 00:07:23.526 That is ridiculous.
00:07:23.526 00:07:25.570 Am I gonna tell them?
00:07:23.526 00:07:25.570 No, I'm not going to tell them.
00:07:25.570 00:07:26.821 I don't see
00:07:25.570 00:07:26.821 the point of that.
00:07:26.821 00:07:29.074 As a doctor, you would not
00:07:26.821 00:07:29.074 tell a patient
00:07:29.074 00:07:30.658 if they had cancer.
00:07:30.658 00:07:31.659 Hey!
00:07:31.659 00:07:33.494 - Hey!
00:07:31.659 00:07:33.494 - This is Mr. Scott.
00:07:33.494 00:07:35.496 Guilty!
00:07:33.494 00:07:35.496 Guilty as charged.
00:07:35.496 00:07:36.915 Ryan Howard
00:07:35.496 00:07:36.915 from the temp agency.
00:07:36.915 00:07:37.958 Uh-huh.
00:07:37.958 00:07:39.500 Daniqua sent me down
00:07:37.958 00:07:39.500 to start today.
00:07:39.500 00:07:41.753 Howard, like Moe Howard,
00:07:39.500 00:07:41.753 Three Stooges.
00:07:41.753 00:07:43.504 Watch this, this is Moe.
00:07:43.504 00:07:45.048 Nyuck! Nyuck! Nyuck!
00:07:43.504 00:07:45.048 Nyuck! Nyuck!
00:07:45.048 00:07:47.508 Meeeeh!
00:07:45.048 00:07:47.508 Ha ha!
00:07:47.508 00:07:49.344 Ah, right here.
00:07:47.508 00:07:49.344 Three Stooges.
00:07:49.344 00:07:51.305 High five!
00:07:49.344 00:07:51.305 Oh, Pam.
00:07:51.305 00:07:52.431 It's a guy thing, Pam.
00:07:52.431 00:07:54.349 I'm sort of
00:07:52.431 00:07:54.349 a student of comedy.
00:07:54.349 00:07:56.268 Heh heh.
00:07:54.349 00:07:56.268 Watch this.
00:07:56.268 00:07:57.518 Here I go.
00:07:56.268 00:07:57.518 Heh heh.
00:07:57.518 00:08:03.275 [imitating Hitler]
00:08:03.275 00:08:04.943 [laughing]
00:08:04.943 00:08:06.403 I'm Hitler!
00:08:06.403 00:08:08.447 Adolf Hitler.
00:08:08.447 00:08:09.739 [imitating Hitler]
00:08:09.739 00:08:11.532 I don't think it would be
00:08:09.739 00:08:11.532 the worst thing
00:08:11.532 00:08:13.076 if they let me go.
00:08:13.076 00:08:15.536 Because then I might--
00:08:15.536 00:08:18.039 I just, I don't think
00:08:15.536 00:08:18.039 it's many little girls' dream
00:08:18.039 00:08:20.292 to be a receptionist.
00:08:20.292 00:08:22.336 Um, I like to do
00:08:20.292 00:08:22.336 illustrations.
00:08:22.336 00:08:24.587 Um, mostly watercolor.
00:08:24.587 00:08:28.549 A few oil pencil.
00:08:24.587 00:08:28.549 Um...
00:08:28.549 00:08:30.551 Jim thinks
00:08:28.549 00:08:30.551 they're good.
00:08:30.551 00:08:32.346 Dunder Mifflin,
00:08:30.551 00:08:32.346 this is Pam.
00:08:32.346 00:08:35.140 Sure. Uh, Mr. Davis,
00:08:32.346 00:08:35.140 let me call you right back.
00:08:35.140 00:08:36.808 Yeah, something just came up.
00:08:35.140 00:08:36.808 Two minutes.
00:08:36.808 00:08:39.019 Thank you very much.
00:08:39.019 00:08:40.395 Dwight,
00:08:39.019 00:08:40.395 what are you doing?
00:08:40.395 00:08:42.022 - What?
00:08:40.395 00:08:42.022 - What are you doing?
00:08:42.022 00:08:43.815 Just clearing my desk.
00:08:42.022 00:08:43.815 I can't concentrate.
00:08:43.815 00:08:44.858 It's not on your desk.
00:08:44.858 00:08:46.067 It's overlapping.
00:08:46.067 00:08:47.652 It's all spilling
00:08:46.067 00:08:47.652 over the edge.
00:08:47.652 00:08:51.531 One word, two syllables:
00:08:47.652 00:08:51.531 demarcation.
00:08:59.539 00:09:01.291 - You can't do that.
00:08:59.539 00:09:01.291 - Why not?
00:09:02.459 00:09:03.626 Safety violation.
00:09:03.626 00:09:06.587 I could fall and pierce...
00:09:03.626 00:09:06.587 an organ.
00:09:06.587 00:09:08.715 We'll see.
00:09:12.760 00:09:14.888 See, this is why
00:09:12.760 00:09:14.888 the whole downsizing thing
00:09:14.888 00:09:16.431 just doesn't bother me.
00:09:16.431 00:09:17.891 Downsizing?
00:09:16.431 00:09:17.891 Downsizing?
00:09:17.891 00:09:19.600 Yeah, I have
00:09:17.891 00:09:19.600 no problem with that.
00:09:19.600 00:09:21.602 I have been
00:09:19.600 00:09:21.602 recommending downsizing
00:09:21.602 00:09:23.563 since I first got here.
00:09:23.563 00:09:25.690 I even brought it up
00:09:23.563 00:09:25.690 in my interview.
00:09:25.690 00:09:27.984 I say bring it on.
00:09:29.610 00:09:31.612 You just still have
00:09:29.610 00:09:31.612 these messages from yesterday.
00:09:31.612 00:09:33.614 Relax, everything's
00:09:31.612 00:09:33.614 under control.
00:09:33.614 00:09:35.742 Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, yeah.
00:09:35.742 00:09:37.618 Oh, that's important.
00:09:35.742 00:09:37.618 Rrrright.
00:09:37.618 00:09:41.622 Oh, this is so important
00:09:37.618 00:09:41.622 I should run to answer it.
00:09:41.622 00:09:43.333 Sha-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta!
00:09:43.333 00:09:45.626 Sha-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta!
00:09:45.626 00:09:47.628 Sha-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta!
00:09:47.628 00:09:49.630 Sha-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta!
00:09:49.630 00:09:51.716 Sha-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta!
00:09:51.716 00:09:54.428 Sha-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta!
00:09:54.428 00:09:56.888 Sha-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta!
00:09:56.888 00:09:59.640 Sha-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta!
00:09:59.640 00:10:00.934 Sha-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta!
00:10:00.934 00:10:02.060 What?
00:10:02.060 00:10:03.644 Come on!
00:10:03.644 00:10:05.272 "Six Million Dollar Man"!
00:10:05.272 00:10:06.523 Steve Austin!
00:10:06.523 00:10:08.733 Actually, that would be
00:10:06.523 00:10:08.733 a good salary for me,
00:10:08.733 00:10:09.859 don't you think?
00:10:09.859 00:10:10.985 $6 million?
00:10:10.985 00:10:13.654 Memo to Jan:
00:10:10.985 00:10:13.654 I deserve a raise.
00:10:13.654 00:10:15.115 Don't we all?
00:10:15.115 00:10:16.657 I'm sorry?
00:10:16.657 00:10:19.202 It's nothing.
00:10:19.202 00:10:22.122 If you're unhappy
00:10:19.202 00:10:22.122 with your compensation,
00:10:22.122 00:10:24.332 maybe you should
00:10:22.122 00:10:24.332 take it up with H.R.
00:10:24.332 00:10:25.417 Okay?
00:10:25.417 00:10:26.876 Not today, okay?
00:10:26.876 00:10:29.296 Pam, just...
00:10:26.876 00:10:29.296 be professional.
00:10:31.672 00:10:33.841 [sighs]
00:10:33.841 00:10:36.303 I think I'm
00:10:33.841 00:10:36.303 a role model here.
00:10:36.303 00:10:38.054 I think I garner
00:10:36.303 00:10:38.054 people's respect.
00:10:38.054 00:10:40.890 Attention all Dunder Mifflin
00:10:38.054 00:10:40.890 employees, please.
00:10:40.890 00:10:42.642 We have a meeting
00:10:40.890 00:10:42.642 in the conference room
00:10:42.642 00:10:44.394 A.S.A.P.
00:10:44.394 00:10:46.687 People I respect,
00:10:44.394 00:10:46.687 heroes of mine, would be...
00:10:46.687 00:10:48.731 Bob Hope.
00:10:48.731 00:10:53.487 Um...
00:10:48.731 00:10:53.487 Abraham Lincoln.
00:10:53.487 00:10:55.780 Definitely.
00:10:55.780 00:10:59.951 Bono.
00:10:59.951 00:11:02.703 Uh, and probably God...
00:11:02.703 00:11:06.124 would be the fourth one.
00:11:06.124 00:11:08.126 And I just think
00:11:06.124 00:11:08.126 all those people
00:11:08.126 00:11:11.588 really helped the world
00:11:11.588 00:11:14.341 in so many ways
00:11:14.341 00:11:17.010 that it's, um...
00:11:17.010 00:11:19.012 it's really beyond words.
00:11:21.389 00:11:24.225 [mispronouncing]
00:11:21.389 00:11:24.225 It's really incalcalacable.
00:11:24.225 00:11:25.852 Now, I know there are
00:11:24.225 00:11:25.852 some rumors out there,
00:11:25.852 00:11:27.728 and I just kinda wanna
00:11:25.852 00:11:27.728 set the record straight--
00:11:27.728 00:11:29.814 I'm Assistant Regional Manger.
00:11:27.728 00:11:29.814 I should know first.
00:11:29.814 00:11:31.399 Assistant
00:11:29.814 00:11:31.399 to the Regional Manager.
00:11:31.399 00:11:32.775 Okay, um, can you
00:11:31.399 00:11:32.775 just tell me, please?
00:11:32.775 00:11:34.735 Just tell me quietly.
00:11:32.775 00:11:34.735 Whisper it in my ear.
00:11:34.735 00:11:35.987 I'm just about
00:11:34.735 00:11:35.987 to tell everyone.
00:11:35.987 00:11:37.614 - Can't you just tell us--
00:11:35.987 00:11:37.614 - Please!
00:11:37.614 00:11:38.948 Okay?
00:11:37.614 00:11:38.948 Do you want me to tell them?
00:11:38.948 00:11:40.241 You don't know
00:11:38.948 00:11:40.241 what it is.
00:11:40.241 00:11:41.409 [chuckles]
00:11:41.409 00:11:42.910 Okay, you tell them.
00:11:41.409 00:11:42.910 With my permission.
00:11:42.910 00:11:43.911 I don't need--
00:11:43.911 00:11:45.288 Permission granted.
00:11:43.911 00:11:45.288 Go ahead.
00:11:45.288 00:11:47.748 Corporate has
00:11:45.288 00:11:47.748 deemed it appropriate
00:11:47.748 00:11:50.793 to enforce an ultimatum
00:11:47.748 00:11:50.793 upon me.
00:11:50.793 00:11:53.754 And, uh, Jan is thinking
00:11:50.793 00:11:53.754 about downsizing
00:11:53.754 00:11:56.508 either the Stanford branch
00:11:53.754 00:11:56.508 or this branch.
00:11:56.508 00:11:59.135 I heard they might be closing
00:11:56.508 00:11:59.135 this branch down.
00:11:59.135 00:12:00.761 That's just...
00:12:00.761 00:12:02.138 That's just a rumor
00:12:00.761 00:12:02.138 going around.
00:12:02.138 00:12:03.764 This is my first day.
00:12:02.138 00:12:03.764 I don't really know.
00:12:03.764 00:12:05.724 Yeah, but, Michael,
00:12:03.764 00:12:05.724 what if they downsize here?
00:12:05.724 00:12:06.767 Not gonna happen.
00:12:06.767 00:12:08.395 It could be
00:12:06.767 00:12:08.395 out of your hands, Michael.
00:12:08.395 00:12:11.772 It won't be out of my hands,
00:12:08.395 00:12:11.772 Stanley, okay?
00:12:11.772 00:12:12.773 I promise you that.
00:12:12.773 00:12:13.774 Oh, can you promise that?
00:12:13.774 00:12:15.151 On his mother's grave.
00:12:15.151 00:12:16.695 Well...
00:12:16.695 00:12:17.862 No!
00:12:17.862 00:12:19.822 Well, yeah,
00:12:17.862 00:12:19.822 it is a promise.
00:12:19.822 00:12:22.367 And, frankly,
00:12:19.822 00:12:22.367 I'm a little bit insulted
00:12:22.367 00:12:23.784 that you have to keep
00:12:22.367 00:12:23.784 asking about it.
00:12:23.784 00:12:25.286 It's just
00:12:23.784 00:12:25.286 that we need to know.
00:12:25.286 00:12:27.788 I-I know.
00:12:25.286 00:12:27.788 Hold on a second.
00:12:27.788 00:12:29.332 I think Pam wanted
00:12:27.788 00:12:29.332 to say something.
00:12:29.332 00:12:32.043 Pam, you, uh...
00:12:32.043 00:12:34.795 had a look that you
00:12:32.043 00:12:34.795 wanted to ask a question
00:12:34.795 00:12:37.298 just now.
00:12:37.298 00:12:39.050 I was in the meeting
00:12:37.298 00:12:39.050 with Jan,
00:12:39.050 00:12:41.469 and she did say
00:12:39.050 00:12:41.469 that it could be this branch
00:12:41.469 00:12:42.679 that gets the axe.
00:12:42.679 00:12:44.805 (Stanley)
00:12:42.679 00:12:44.805 Are you sure about that?
00:12:44.805 00:12:45.932 Look, Pam...
00:12:45.932 00:12:47.350 Uh, maybe
00:12:45.932 00:12:47.350 you should stick
00:12:47.350 00:12:50.520 to the ongoing confidentiality
00:12:47.350 00:12:50.520 agreement of meetings.
00:12:50.520 00:12:52.606 Pam, information is power.
00:12:52.606 00:12:53.814 So...
00:12:53.814 00:12:55.066 (Stanley)
00:12:53.814 00:12:55.066 So you can't say for sure
00:12:55.066 00:12:56.817 whether it's gonna
00:12:55.066 00:12:56.817 be us or them, can you?
00:12:56.817 00:12:58.819 No, no, no, no.
00:12:56.817 00:12:58.819 Stanley, no.
00:12:58.819 00:13:01.030 You did not see me
00:12:58.819 00:13:01.030 in there with her.
00:13:01.030 00:13:03.824 I said if,
00:13:01.030 00:13:03.824 uh, if corporate
00:13:03.824 00:13:05.826 wants to come in here
00:13:03.824 00:13:05.826 and interfere,
00:13:05.826 00:13:07.786 then they're gonna
00:13:05.826 00:13:07.786 have to go through me.
00:13:07.786 00:13:08.955 Right?
00:13:08.955 00:13:11.082 You know, you can go
00:13:08.955 00:13:11.082 mess with Josh's people.
00:13:11.082 00:13:12.875 But I'm the head
00:13:11.082 00:13:12.875 of this family,
00:13:12.875 00:13:16.795 and you ain't gonna be
00:13:12.875 00:13:16.795 messin' with my chillun'.
00:13:23.136 00:13:25.472 If I left,
00:13:23.136 00:13:25.472 what would I do with...
00:13:25.472 00:13:28.849 all this useless
00:13:25.472 00:13:28.849 information in my head?
00:13:28.849 00:13:33.521 You know?
00:13:28.849 00:13:33.521 Tonnage price of manila folders?
00:13:33.521 00:13:35.898 Um, Pam's favorite
00:13:33.521 00:13:35.898 flavor of yogurt,
00:13:35.898 00:13:37.233 which is mixed berry.
00:13:41.862 00:13:43.030 Jim said mixed berries?
00:13:45.283 00:13:47.952 Oh, well, yeah,
00:13:45.283 00:13:47.952 he's on to me.
00:13:47.952 00:13:50.163 Um...
00:13:50.163 00:13:52.499 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
00:13:50.163 00:13:52.499 Watch out for this guy.
00:13:52.499 00:13:54.292 Dwight Schrute
00:13:52.499 00:13:54.292 in the building.
00:13:54.292 00:13:55.460 This is Ryan,
00:13:54.292 00:13:55.460 the new temp.
00:13:55.460 00:13:56.795 - What's up?
00:13:55.460 00:13:56.795 - Nice to meet you.
00:13:56.795 00:13:57.962 Introduce yourself.
00:13:56.795 00:13:57.962 Be polite.
00:13:57.962 00:14:00.173 Uh, Dwight Schrute,
00:13:57.962 00:14:00.173 Assistant Regional Manager.
00:14:00.173 00:14:02.216 Assistant
00:14:00.173 00:14:02.216 to the Regional Manager.
00:14:02.216 00:14:04.885 So, uh, Dwight,
00:14:02.216 00:14:04.885 tell him about the Kung Fu
00:14:04.885 00:14:06.887 and the car and everything.
00:14:06.887 00:14:09.766 Uh, yeah, I got a '78 280Z.
00:14:09.766 00:14:10.933 I bought it for 1,200,
00:14:09.766 00:14:10.933 fixed it up.
00:14:10.933 00:14:12.059 It's now worth three grand.
00:14:12.059 00:14:13.102 That is his profit.
00:14:13.102 00:14:14.895 Yeah, uh, new engine,
00:14:13.102 00:14:14.895 suspension.
00:14:14.895 00:14:17.315 I got a respray.
00:14:14.895 00:14:17.315 I got some photos.
00:14:17.315 00:14:19.442 Oh! Damn it!
00:14:19.442 00:14:20.610 Damn it! I--
00:14:20.610 00:14:22.696 Hold on, hold on.
00:14:20.610 00:14:22.696 Judge is in session.
00:14:22.696 00:14:24.113 What is the problem here?
00:14:24.113 00:14:26.616 He put my stuff
00:14:24.113 00:14:26.616 in Jell-O again!
00:14:26.616 00:14:28.909 [Pam laughing]
00:14:28.909 00:14:30.453 That's real professional.
00:14:28.909 00:14:30.453 Thanks.
00:14:30.453 00:14:32.038 This is the third time,
00:14:30.453 00:14:32.038 and it wasn't funny
00:14:32.038 00:14:33.414 the first two times
00:14:32.038 00:14:33.414 either, Jim!
00:14:33.414 00:14:34.708 It's okay here.
00:14:34.708 00:14:36.917 Uh, but people sometimes
00:14:34.708 00:14:36.917 take advantage
00:14:36.917 00:14:38.503 because it's so relaxed.
00:14:38.503 00:14:42.465 I'm a volunteer sheriff's
00:14:38.503 00:14:42.465 deputy on the weekends.
00:14:42.465 00:14:44.925 And you cannot
00:14:42.465 00:14:44.925 screw around there.
00:14:44.925 00:14:47.011 It's sort of
00:14:44.925 00:14:47.011 one of the rules.
00:14:47.011 00:14:48.012 [laughing]
00:14:47.011 00:14:48.012 What is that?
00:14:48.012 00:14:49.013 That's my stapler.
00:14:49.013 00:14:50.931 No, no!
00:14:49.013 00:14:50.931 Do not take it out.
00:14:50.931 00:14:52.350 You have to eat it
00:14:50.931 00:14:52.350 out of there,
00:14:52.350 00:14:54.268 because there are
00:14:52.350 00:14:54.268 starving people in the world,
00:14:54.268 00:14:55.478 and, which I hate,
00:14:55.478 00:14:57.397 and it it is a waste
00:14:55.478 00:14:57.397 of that kind of food.
00:14:57.397 00:14:58.939 You know what?
00:14:57.397 00:14:58.939 You can be a witness.
00:14:58.939 00:15:00.233 Can you reprimand him, please?
00:15:01.942 00:15:03.361 How do you know it was me?
00:15:03.361 00:15:04.445 (Dwight)
00:15:03.361 00:15:04.445 It's always you.
00:15:04.445 00:15:05.946 Are you gonna
00:15:04.445 00:15:05.946 discipline him or not?
00:15:05.946 00:15:07.615 Ooh, discipline, kinky!
00:15:07.615 00:15:10.284 All right, here's
00:15:07.615 00:15:10.284 the deal, you guys.
00:15:10.284 00:15:12.953 Thing about a practical joke
00:15:10.284 00:15:12.953 is that you have to know
00:15:12.953 00:15:15.206 when to start
00:15:12.953 00:15:15.206 as well as when to stop.
00:15:15.206 00:15:16.374 And, yeah,
00:15:16.374 00:15:18.918 Jim, now is the time
00:15:18.918 00:15:21.588 to stop putting
00:15:18.918 00:15:21.588 Dwight's personal effects
00:15:21.588 00:15:23.964 into Jell-O.
00:15:23.964 00:15:25.508 [clears throat]
00:15:23.964 00:15:25.508 Okay.
00:15:25.508 00:15:27.301 Dwight, I'm sorry,
00:15:25.508 00:15:27.301 because...
00:15:27.301 00:15:30.304 I have always been
00:15:27.301 00:15:30.304 your biggest flan.
00:15:30.304 00:15:31.389 [laughs]
00:15:31.389 00:15:33.600 Ho ho ho, nice!
00:15:33.600 00:15:35.226 That's the way
00:15:33.600 00:15:35.226 it is around here.
00:15:35.226 00:15:36.977 It just kind of goes
00:15:35.226 00:15:36.977 round and round and round.
00:15:36.977 00:15:39.355 You, uh, you should have
00:15:36.977 00:15:39.355 put him in "custardy."
00:15:39.355 00:15:41.065 Oh, hey!
00:15:39.355 00:15:41.065 Yes!
00:15:41.065 00:15:43.777 New guy!
00:15:41.065 00:15:43.777 And he scores.
00:15:43.777 00:15:44.944 Okay, that's great.
00:15:44.944 00:15:46.905 I guess what I'm
00:15:44.944 00:15:46.905 most concerned with
00:15:46.905 00:15:49.449 is damage
00:15:46.905 00:15:49.449 to company property.
00:15:49.449 00:15:51.117 That's all.
00:15:54.871 00:15:56.205 Pudding.
00:15:56.205 00:15:57.998 Putting.
00:15:57.998 00:16:01.628 I'm trying to think
00:15:57.998 00:16:01.628 what other dessert to do.
00:16:01.628 00:16:03.087 [laughs]
00:16:03.087 00:16:04.422 Do you like going out
00:16:04.422 00:16:06.048 at the end of the week
00:16:04.422 00:16:06.048 for a drink?
00:16:06.048 00:16:07.508 Yeah.
00:16:07.508 00:16:09.009 Well, that's why
00:16:07.508 00:16:09.009 we're all going out.
00:16:09.009 00:16:10.970 So that we can have
00:16:09.009 00:16:10.970 an end-of-the-week drink.
00:16:10.970 00:16:12.012 So when are we going out?
00:16:12.012 00:16:13.389 I don't know.
00:16:12.012 00:16:13.389 Tonight, hopefully.
00:16:13.389 00:16:14.974 Okay, yeah.
00:16:17.310 00:16:18.352 Hey, man.
00:16:18.352 00:16:19.854 - Hey!
00:16:18.352 00:16:19.854 - What's going on?
00:16:19.854 00:16:21.021 - Hi, baby.
00:16:19.854 00:16:21.021 - Hey.
00:16:21.021 00:16:22.482 Uh, Roy is my fiance.
00:16:22.482 00:16:25.276 We've been engaged
00:16:22.482 00:16:25.276 about, um...
00:16:25.276 00:16:27.027 about three years.
00:16:27.027 00:16:30.030 And, uh, we were supposed
00:16:27.027 00:16:30.030 to get married in September,
00:16:30.030 00:16:33.785 but I think we're gonna
00:16:30.030 00:16:33.785 get married in the spring.
00:16:33.785 00:16:37.037 Do you mind if I go out
00:16:33.785 00:16:37.037 for a drink with these guys?
00:16:37.037 00:16:38.581 Uh, no, no,
00:16:37.037 00:16:38.581 come on.
00:16:38.581 00:16:40.583 Let's get out of here,
00:16:38.581 00:16:40.583 go home.
00:16:40.583 00:16:43.544 Okay, um, I'm gonna be
00:16:40.583 00:16:43.544 a few minutes, though.
00:16:43.544 00:16:45.755 It's only 20 past 5:00.
00:16:45.755 00:16:47.340 I still have
00:16:45.755 00:16:47.340 to do my faxes.
00:16:51.594 00:16:54.054 You know what?
00:16:51.594 00:16:54.054 You should come with us.
00:16:54.054 00:16:55.640 Because, you know,
00:16:54.054 00:16:55.640 we're all going out,
00:16:55.640 00:16:57.517 and it could be
00:16:55.640 00:16:57.517 a good chance for you to...
00:16:57.517 00:16:59.560 see what people are like
00:16:57.517 00:16:59.560 outside of the office.
00:16:59.560 00:17:01.228 You know, I think
00:16:59.560 00:17:01.228 it could be fun.
00:17:01.228 00:17:02.563 No, it sounds good.
00:17:02.563 00:17:03.731 Oh, no.
00:17:03.731 00:17:05.024 Seriously,
00:17:03.731 00:17:05.024 we gotta get going.
00:17:05.024 00:17:06.275 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:17:15.075 00:17:20.080 Um...what's in the--
00:17:15.075 00:17:20.080 what's in the bag?
00:17:20.080 00:17:21.624 Just tell her
00:17:20.080 00:17:21.624 I'll talk to her later.
00:17:21.624 00:17:23.250 No, definitely.
00:17:21.624 00:17:23.250 All right, dude, awesome.
00:17:23.250 00:17:24.878 Will do.
00:17:28.088 00:17:30.090 (Jim)
00:17:28.088 00:17:30.090 Do I think
00:17:30.090 00:17:32.886 I'll be invited
00:17:30.090 00:17:32.886 to the wedding?
00:17:39.893 00:17:43.103 So, uh, have you
00:17:39.893 00:17:43.103 felt a vibe yet?
00:17:43.103 00:17:44.898 We work hard,
00:17:43.103 00:17:44.898 we play hard.
00:17:44.898 00:17:47.107 Sometimes we play hard
00:17:44.898 00:17:47.107 when we should be working hard.
00:17:47.107 00:17:48.317 Right?
00:17:48.317 00:17:51.821 Um, I guess the atmosphere
00:17:48.317 00:17:51.821 that I've created here
00:17:51.821 00:17:53.823 is that I'm a friend first
00:17:53.823 00:17:55.449 and a boss second.
00:17:55.449 00:17:57.117 Probably, uh--
00:17:55.449 00:17:57.117 [knock on door]
00:17:57.117 00:17:58.118 Entertainer third.
00:17:58.118 00:18:01.121 Just a second!
00:17:58.118 00:18:01.121 Right?
00:18:01.121 00:18:04.250 Oh, hey, do you, uh, do you like
00:18:01.121 00:18:04.250 "The Jamie Kennedy Experiment"?

00:18:05.585 00:18:07.211 "Punk'd" and all
00:18:05.585 00:18:07.211 that kind of stuff?

00:18:35.990 00:18:40.453 to have to let you go first.
00:18:40.453 00:18:42.329 What? Why?
00:18:42.329 00:18:44.457 Why?
00:18:42.329 00:18:44.457 Well, theft.
00:18:44.457 00:18:45.666 And stealing.
00:18:45.666 00:18:46.626 Stealing?
00:18:46.626 00:18:47.752 Mm-hmm.
00:18:47.752 00:18:50.838 Um, what am I supposed
00:18:47.752 00:18:50.838 to have stolen?
00:18:50.838 00:18:52.465 Post-it notes.
00:18:52.465 00:18:54.133 - Post-it notes?
00:18:52.465 00:18:54.133 - Yeah.
00:18:54.133 00:18:56.052 What are those worth,
00:18:54.133 00:18:56.052 like, 50 cents?
00:18:56.052 00:18:57.177 50 cents, yeah.
00:18:57.177 00:18:59.513 You steal 1,000 Post-It notes
00:18:57.177 00:18:59.513 at 50 cents apiece,
00:18:59.513 00:19:03.101 and, you know, you've
00:18:59.513 00:19:03.101 made a profit...margin.
00:19:03.101 00:19:05.478 You know, gonna run us
00:19:03.101 00:19:05.478 out of business, Pam.
00:19:05.478 00:19:07.229 Are you serious?
00:19:08.606 00:19:10.190 Yeah, I, um...
00:19:10.190 00:19:13.193 Oh, my--
00:19:10.190 00:19:13.193 I can't believe this.
00:19:13.193 00:19:16.114 I mean, I've never even
00:19:13.193 00:19:16.114 stolen as much as a paper clip,
00:19:16.114 00:19:18.491 and now you're firing me.
00:19:18.491 00:19:20.660 And the best thing about it
00:19:18.491 00:19:20.660 is that, uh,
00:19:20.660 00:19:24.288 we're not gonna have
00:19:20.660 00:19:24.288 to give you any severance pay.
00:19:24.288 00:19:28.459 Because that is
00:19:24.288 00:19:28.459 gross misconduct, and, uh...
00:19:28.459 00:19:31.629 So just clean out your desk.
00:19:28.459 00:19:31.629 I'm sorry.
00:19:38.218 00:19:39.345 [sniffling]
00:19:48.479 00:19:51.440 You've been "Xed," punk!
00:19:51.440 00:19:53.233 Surprise!
00:19:51.440 00:19:53.233 It's a joke!
00:19:53.233 00:19:54.443 We were joking around!
00:19:54.443 00:19:55.611 [laughs]
00:19:54.443 00:19:55.611 See?
00:19:55.611 00:19:57.237 Okay, he was in on it.
00:19:57.237 00:19:58.614 He was my accomplice.
00:19:58.614 00:20:01.993 And it was just kind of
00:19:58.614 00:20:01.993 a morale booster thing.
00:20:01.993 00:20:05.579 And we were showing
00:20:01.993 00:20:05.579 the new guy around, kind of--
00:20:05.579 00:20:07.665 kind of giving him
00:20:05.579 00:20:07.665 the feel of the place.
00:20:07.665 00:20:10.043 So you sh--
00:20:10.043 00:20:12.252 God, you were--
00:20:10.043 00:20:12.252 We totally got you--
00:20:12.252 00:20:14.338 You're a jerk!
00:20:14.338 00:20:16.007 Ah, I don't know
00:20:14.338 00:20:16.007 about that.
00:20:31.814 00:20:33.273 (Michael)
00:20:31.814 00:20:33.273 What is the most
00:20:33.273 00:20:35.275 important thing
00:20:33.273 00:20:35.275 for a company?
00:20:35.275 00:20:39.279 Is it the cash flow?
00:20:35.275 00:20:39.279 Is it the inventory?
00:20:39.279 00:20:41.281 Nuh-uh.
00:20:41.281 00:20:43.283 It's the people.
00:20:43.283 00:20:45.870 The people.
00:20:45.870 00:20:47.287 My proudest moment here
00:20:47.287 00:20:50.666 was not when
00:20:47.287 00:20:50.666 I increased profits by 17%.
00:20:50.666 00:20:53.293 Or when I cut expenses
00:20:53.293 00:20:54.837 without losing
00:20:53.293 00:20:54.837 a single employee.
00:20:54.837 00:20:56.296 No, no, no, no, no.
00:20:56.296 00:20:59.675 It was a young
00:20:56.296 00:20:59.675 Guatemalan guy.
00:20:59.675 00:21:02.302 First job in the country,
00:20:59.675 00:21:02.302 barely spoke English.
00:21:02.302 00:21:04.847 Came to me and said,
00:21:04.847 00:21:07.307 [Spanish accent]
00:21:04.847 00:21:07.307 "Mr. Scott,
00:21:07.307 00:21:13.272 would you be the godfather
00:21:07.307 00:21:13.272 of my child?"
00:21:13.272 00:21:16.316 Wow. Wow.
00:21:16.316 00:21:18.069 Wow.
00:21:21.321 00:21:22.740 Didn't work out in the end.
00:21:22.740 00:21:24.366 We had to let him go.
00:21:22.740 00:21:24.366 He sucked.
00:21:28.913 00:21:30.330 [sniffles]
00:21:30.330 00:21:31.457 Hey.
00:21:31.457 00:21:33.000 - Hey.
00:21:31.457 00:21:33.000 - Hi.
00:21:33.000 00:21:34.252 - How are you?
00:21:33.000 00:21:34.252 - Good.
00:21:34.252 00:21:36.462 I thought you were
00:21:34.252 00:21:36.462 going out for a drink with--
00:21:36.462 00:21:38.297 Oh, no, no.
00:21:38.297 00:21:40.507 Just going to, uh...
00:21:40.507 00:21:42.342 How's your headache?
00:21:42.342 00:21:43.594 - It's better. Thanks.
00:21:42.342 00:21:43.594 - Good.
00:21:43.594 00:21:45.345 Good, that's great.
00:21:45.345 00:21:47.056 - Is, uh--
00:21:45.345 00:21:47.056 - Yeah?
00:21:47.056 00:21:49.600 Um, are you, uh...
00:21:49.600 00:21:50.768 Am I walking out?
00:21:50.768 00:21:52.061 Yes.
00:21:52.061 00:21:53.562 Yes.
00:21:52.061 00:21:53.562 Do you wanna?
00:21:53.562 00:21:55.397 - Yeah.
00:21:53.562 00:21:55.397 - Great.
00:21:55.397 00:21:57.357 Let me just--
00:21:55.397 00:21:57.357 [car horn honks]
00:21:57.357 00:21:59.359 - Oh, Roy.
00:21:57.357 00:21:59.359 - Yeah.
00:21:59.359 00:22:00.736 Listen,
00:21:59.359 00:22:00.736 have a nice weekend.
00:22:00.736 00:22:03.114 Yeah, definitely.
00:22:00.736 00:22:03.114 You too.
00:22:03.114 00:22:04.782 Enjoy it.
00:22:07.576 00:22:09.620 [door closes]
00:22:16.252 00:22:18.671 Uh...you know what?
